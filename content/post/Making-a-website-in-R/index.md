## R Markdown, Blogdown, Netlify and rolling your own CV website

Before deciding to pursue a PhD, I had already developed a web-presence based around my skeletal reconstructions of living and extinct (mostly extinct) vertebrates that I've produced over the last 25 years. While I haven't given up the anatomy diagram business, it's become clear to me that my students, collaborators and colleagues don't necessarily want to wade through unrelated content to find my courses, publications, and current contact information. And in all likelihood many visitors to www.skeletaldrawing.com are not terribly interested in which courses I teach, or my current (non-skeletal) research projects.

So this is my second home on the internet. Or the first, depending on what you are looking for. I plan to use this platform to talk about pedagogy, ongoing research projects (that are not explicitly about the skeletal anatomy of long-dead stuff) and other parts of academic life. Obviously, all opinions are my own.
