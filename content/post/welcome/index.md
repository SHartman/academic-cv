## Welcome to my other home on the internet!

Before returning to school to get my PhD, I already had a web-presence for the skeletal reconstructions of living and extinct (mostly extinct) I've produced over the last 25 years. While I haven't given up the anatomy diagram business, so to speak, it's become clear to me that most of my students, collaborators and colleagues don't necessarily want to wade through unrelated content to find out more about courses, publications, and current contact information. And in all likelihood many visitors to www.skeletaldrawing.com are not terribly interested in which coures I teach, or my current (non-skeletal) research projects.

So this is my second home on the internet. Or the first, depending on what you are looking for. I plan to use this platform to talk about pedagogy, ongoing research projects (that are not explicitly about the skeletal anatomy of long-dead stuff) and other parts of academic life. Obviously, all opinions are my own!

Oh, and if you are hoping for more skeletal reconstructions as well, don't worry, I have plenty of material coming down the pike.
