abstract: 'We describe the tenth skeletal specimen of the Upper Jurassic Archaeopterygidae. The almost complete and well-preserved skeleton is assigned to *Archaeopteryx siemensii* Dames, 1897 and provides significant new information on the osteology of the Archaeopterygidae. As is evident from the new specimen, the palatine of *Archaeopteryx* was tetraradiate as in non-avian theropods, and not triradiate as in other avians. Also with respect to the position of the ectopterygoid, the data obtained from the new specimen lead to a revision of a previous reconstruction of the palate of *Archaeopteryx*. The morphology of the coracoid and that of the proximal tarsals is, for the first time, clearly visible in the new specimen. The new specimen demonstrates the presence of a hyperextendible second toe in *Archaeopteryx*. This feature is otherwise known only from the basal avian *Rahonavis* and deinonychosaurs (Dromaeosauridae and Troodontidae), and its presence in *Archaeopteryx* provides additional evidence for a close relationship between deinonychosaurs and avians. The new specimen also shows that the first toe of *Archaeopteryx* was not fully reversed but spread medially, supporting previous assumptions that *Archaeopteryx* was only facultatively arboreal. Finally, we comment on the taxonomic composition of the Archaeopterygidae and conclude that *Archaeopteryx bavarica* Wellnhofer, 1993 is likely to be a junior synonym of *A. siemensii*, and *Wellnhoferia grandis* Elzanowski, 2001 a junior synonym of *A. lithographica* von Meyer, 1861.'
