abstract: 'Body shape is a fundamental expression of organismal biology, but its quantitative
reconstruction in fossil vertebrates is rare. Due to the absence of fossilized soft tissue
evidence, the functional consequences of basal paravian body shape and its implications
for the origins of avians and flight are not yet fully understood. Here we reconstruct the
quantitative body outline of a fossil paravian *Anchiornis* based on high-definition images
of soft tissues revealed by laser-stimulated fluorescence. This body outline confirms
patagia-bearing arms, drumstick-shaped legs and a slender tail, features that were probably
widespread among paravians. Finely preserved details also reveal similarities in propatagial
and footpad form between basal paravians and modern birds, extending their record to
the Late Jurassic. The body outline and soft tissue details suggest significant functional
decoupling between the legs and tail in at least some basal paravians. The number of
seemingly modern propatagial traits hint that feathering was a significant factor in how basal
paravians utilized arm, leg and tail function for aerodynamic benefit.'
