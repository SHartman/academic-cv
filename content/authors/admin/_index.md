# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research include mechanistic physiological modeling, biomechanics, phylogenetics and macroevolutionary patterns and extinction, particularly in Mesozoic vertebrates. I am particularly interested in synthesizing the above data into understanding the life appearance and behavior of dinosaurs, of which I sometimes create rigorous anatomical diagrams.

Like many kids, I grew up loving dinosaurs and natural history. For college (and to be closer to Mesozoic rocks!) I left California to attend the University of Wyoming, where I am forever grateful for the field & museum experience opportunities I was given. I later moved to Thermopolis, WY to manage research and display development as Science Director at The Wyoming Dinosaur Center. At the same time, I pursued an independent scientific illustration career, resulting in a large catalog of skeletal anatomy diagrams - interested parties can explore them at: www.skeletaldrawing.com.

I loved my time in the Mountain West, but managing and facilitating others' research rekindled my drive to become a professional research scientist, so I relocated to Wisconsin to pursue a geoscience Ph.D in paleobiology. My dissertation research emphasized mechanistic physiological modeling, mass extinction survivorship, and functional anatomy. These days I am still in Wisconsin, where I get to teach those same subjects to undergraduates in the Department of Integrative Biology. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have a wonderful wife and daughter, some fur-babies, and in what passes for free time I enjoy movies, photography, cheering for the Green Bay Packers, and PC gaming.
