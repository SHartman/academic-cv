# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research include mechanistic physiological modeling, biomechanics, phylogenetics and macroevolutionary patterns and extinction, particularly in Mesozoic vertebrates. I am particularly interested in synthesizing the above data into understanding the life appearance and behavior of dinosaurs, of which I sometimes create rigorous anatomical diagrams.

Like many kids I loved dinosaurs, and growing up in Wisconsin and California I was exposed to many wonderful natural history museums. That interest, and a desire to be closer to Mesozoic rocks lead me to the University of Wyoming, where I graduated with a B.S. in Zoology. During that time I was fortunate to gain paleontological field & museum experience, and subsequently I found early career success managing research and display development at small museums. During this time I also pursued scientific illustration, and created a large catalog of anatomical diagrams of vertebrate skeletons (extinct and extant) - interested parties can explore that work at my personal website and blog: www.skeletaldrawing.com.

I loved the time I spent working at museums in the Mountain West, but helping manage research programs reawakened my desire to become a professional research scientist. I relocated from Wyoming to Wisconsin to pursue a geoscience Ph.D in paleobiology, with an emphasis on mechanistic physiological modeling, mass extinction survivorship, and functional anatomy. In my spare time I am a husband, father, pet-father, and enjoy movies, photography and PC gaming.
