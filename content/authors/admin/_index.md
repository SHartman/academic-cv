# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research include mechanistic physiological modeling, biomechanics, phylogenetics and macroevolutionary patterns and extinction, particularly in Mesozoic vertebrates. I am particularly interested in synthesizing the above data into understanding the life appearance and behavior of dinosaurs, of which I sometimes create rigorous anatomical diagrams.

I grew up loving dinosaurs and natural history, and a desire to be closer to Mesozoic rocks lead me from California to the University of Wyoming, where I graduated with a B.S. in Zoology. During that time I gain field & museum experience in paleontology, and subsequently I went on to manage research and display development at The Wyoming Dinosaur Museum in Thermopolis, WY. During this time I also pursued an independent scientific illustration career, resulting in a large catalog of skeletal anatomy diagrams - interested parties can explore that work at: www.skeletaldrawing.com.

I loved the time I spent in the Mountain West, but managing and facilitating others' research rekindled my drive to become a professional research scientist. I relocated to Wisconsin, where I pursued a geoscience Ph.D in paleobiology, graduating with an emphasis on mechanistic physiological modeling, mass extinction survivorship, and functional anatomy. Now I get to teach those same subjects to undergraduates in the Department of Integrative Biology. In my spare time I am a husband, father, pet-father, and enjoy movies, photography and PC gaming.
