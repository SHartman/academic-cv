# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My research include mechanistic physiological modeling, biomechanics, phylogenetics and macroevolutionary patterns and extinction, particularly in Mesozoic vertebrates. I am particularly interested in synthesizing the above data into understanding the life appearance and behavior of dinosaurs, of which I sometimes create rigorous anatomical diagrams.

I grew up loving dinosaurs and natural history. To be closer to Mesozoic rocks I left California to attend the University of Wyoming. I am forever grateful for the field & museum experience in paleontology I gained in Laramie. Subsequently I moved to Thermopolis, WY to manage research and display development as Science Director at The Wyoming Dinosaur Center. At the same time, I pursued an independent scientific illustration career, resulting in a large catalog of skeletal anatomy diagrams - interested parties can explore them at: www.skeletaldrawing.com.

I love the Mountain West, but managing and facilitating others' research rekindled my drive to become a professional research scientist, so I relocated to Wisconsin to pursue a geoscience Ph.D in paleobiology, graduating with an emphasis on mechanistic physiological modeling, mass extinction survivorship, and functional anatomy. Now I get to teach those same subjects to undergraduates in the Department of Integrative Biology. In addition to academia, I value my status as a husband, father and pet-father, and in my free time I enjoy movies, photography, cheering for the Packers and PC gaming.
